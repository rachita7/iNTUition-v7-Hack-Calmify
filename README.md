# Calmify 🌸

## 🏆 Winner: 
**Best Women in Tech Hack** at iNTUition v7.0

## 💡 Inspiration: 
During the circuit-breaker period, mental health was significantly impacted as people had to remain isolated from their loved ones. This inspired the creation of **Calmify**, an app designed to provide emotional support and promote self-care in a time of distress.

## 🚀 What It Does: 
**Calmify** is a self-care app that focuses on uplifting users’ spirits. Through personalized self-care activities and sentiment analysis, the app helps users improve their mental well-being and encourages a more positive outlook on life.

## 🛠️ How It Was Built: 
The app was developed using **Flutter** for cross-platform development and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for sentiment analysis. The NLP model analyzes user input to provide tailored self-care suggestions.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced: 
Integrating the app with a cloud server database posed a significant challenge, as we had to ensure data synchronization and reliability across the app.

## 🎉 Key Accomplishments: 
- Successfully created a mental health-focused app that addresses a critical issue in the COVID and post-COVID era.
- Recognized for its innovation in promoting mental wellness.

## 📚 What we Learnt: 
- The experience of working in an all-girls team was both empowering and fun!
- Learned valuable skills in app development, NLP, teamwork, and working under pressure to meet tight deadlines.

## 🔮 What's Next for Calmify: 
We are planning to enhance the app with a **recommendation system** that suggests personalized self-care activities (cards) based on the user’s preferences and mood.
